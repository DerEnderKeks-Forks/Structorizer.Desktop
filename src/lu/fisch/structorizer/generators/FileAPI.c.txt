 *
 *      Comment:
 *      - The API is not exactly equivalent to the Structorizer File API used in Executor
 *      - First of all, the result values of fileOpen, fileCreate, and fileAppend ar not
 *        actually int numbers for FILE* pointers. Hence, a comarison > 0 won't make sense.
 *      - Next, the fileRead function returns a pointer rather than object references. This
 *        pointer is of void* type such that it must first be casted to some meaningful
 *        pointer type in order to fetch the variable value. Unfortunately, there is no
 *        safe way to find out its type. So the user should not make assumptions here but
 *        have a look into the available files and adhere to their structure.
 *      - The simple fileWrite and fileWriteLine routines had to be split into several type-
 *        specific file output functions (e.g. fileWriteInt, fileWriteDouble), whereas the
 *        function fileWrite and fileWriteLine are solely reserved for C-string output.

 * CAUTION: This function returns either NULL or a pointer to the value read from file,

 * In theory, this function should read the next token from the text file given by
 * hFile handle and return it in the appropriate type.
 * Unfortunately, such a behaviour isn't possible in C. We cannot even return a
 * C-String without being provided with a buffer as argument (unless we were allowed
 * to allocate dynamic memory here).
 * So, this functions scans the file for a token and reads it into a fixed global
 * buffer. Then it tries to convert the content into int and double. If any of these
 * conversions succeeds and is unique then the converted value will be placed at the
 * buffer beginning such that dereferencing the returned pointer will provide the
 * value. It must immediately be copied to a variable because the buffer is volatile.
 * Throws an error if the given handle is not associated to an open text input file.

 * @return POINTER TO an int or double variable or a C-string - to be casted appropriately -, or NULL
