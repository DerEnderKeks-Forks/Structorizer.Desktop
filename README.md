# Structorizer

Structorizer is a little tool which you can use to create Nassi-Schneiderman Diagrams (NSD).

# Why having started this project?

In fact, I was not satisfied by the result of other NSD-editors, so I started writing my own one. I think I started drawing the first schemes and thinking about it\'s internal structure in july 2006. The first lines of code were written during the summer and for september a first more of less functional version was available.


# Project history

I will not draw the entire changelog here, but just a few lines that, I think so, could be of interest:

* The first version, called "Structorizer 2006", was written in "Delphi 6 PE".
* In january 2007 I decided to rename the project to "Structorizer", as "2006" did no longer apply and a lot of new features waited to be integrated.
* Somewhat later in 2007 I ported the project for e first time to "Lazarus". I published a Linux version as well as the source code under the terms of the PGL license and called this sub-project "openStructorizer".
* I got my first Mac in may 2007 and wanted to have the application run in native mode. I did a second and this time complete port of the project to "Lazarus". Waiting for the next release to be published, I renamed the old project to "Structorizer (Delphi)" and stopped both of them.
* I will publish Windows, Linux and Mac OSX (intel) ports of the new "Structorizer (Lazarus)" project. This will be completely open-source this time!
* After the release of the Lazarus version, major problems were detected for the Windows port. This is why I came back to the Delphi code and continued developping "Structorizer (Delphi)", which will be published as freeware.
* Due to to many problems with Lazarus, I decided to implement a Structorizer version in JAVA in december 2007. This version, which has also been released under the terms of the GPL, became version number 3.x.
